        Buttons with the class lh-button-toggle can be tied to a hidden input in a form for persistance.
        You need to add a button with the "lh-button-toggle" class and an id, and an input with a name matching that id. The input must be inside a form.
        e.g. The following example is saved as data["myToggle"]
      -->
      <button
        id="myToggle"
        class="lh-button-toggle"
        title="Custom toggleable menu item"

      <form class="lh-page placeholder-background-image">
        <h1>Welcome to localhtml</h1>
        <p>
          Any changes made to the content of these pages is persisted when
          saving, and the full functionality of the document is available
          offline just by opening the HTML file (all the source code and state
          data are included in the file). You can create pages in content.html
          with forms which can save arbitrary data. Form controls serialise to a
          key matching their name property. What name you choose only matters if
          you want to implement your own logic with JavaScript, but every form
          element must have a unique name for it to be saved.
        </p>
        <p>
          e.g. &ltinput name="fileNameField"/&gt is saved to
          data["fileNameField"]
        </p>
        <label>
          <strong>File Name</strong>
          <input type="text" name="fileNameField" />
        </label>
        <p>
          Users can add extra pages using the controls at the bottom of the
          page. These pages can only be full-page rich text editors, but can be
          added, removed, and rearranged at any time. You can also add rich text
          editors to forms, as shown here.
        </p>
        <!-- The lh-quill-field class turns a container into a rich text editor -->
        <article name="myQuillField" class="lh-quill-field"></article>
        <p>
          Each page is 1-to-1 size of US letter paper and when you print the
          document everything else is stripped away, so you can treat the pages
          just like real paper.
        </p>
      </form>

      <h2>Did you know?</h2>
      <p>
        You can add content outside of a page element, but it will be excluded
        when printing.
      </p>

      <form class="lh-page">
        <p>
          You can have multiple pre-defined forms and pages, but they cannot be
          reordered or deleted by the user.
        </p>
        <p>
          The data for all forms is saved as one object, so field names must be
          unique across all forms. However, this also means that you can move
          fields from one form to another without breaking backwards
          compatibility.
        </p>
        <p>
          The data object is generated when needed by reading the form controls,
          so you can modify their values using JavaScript in all the usual ways.
        </p>
